<tr><th>Technical- Vocational Livelihood Track</th></tr>
<tr><td>The Tech-Voc track is divided into four strands. This caters to those who want to work immediately after Senior High School
</td></tr>
<tr><td>a. Home Economics Stand</td></tr>
<tr><td>This is our classic idea of the TLE subject. Those who are interested in housekeeping, tailoring, caregiving, food and beverage services, bread and pastry services, tourism and handicrafts should choose this.

Take note though that this isn’t the correct strand for those who are planning to take Hotel and Restaurant Management (HRM) in college. Most students who choose this have plans to work in the aforementioned areas immediately after Senior High School.</td></tr>

<tr><td>b. Information and Communication Technology Strand</td></tr>
<tr><td>Interested in computers? The ICT Strand is the perfect choice. You’ll be taught how to write computer programs, websites and possibly apps.  This includes Medical Transcription and Computer Animation.

After taking this strand, you can then proceed to BSIT in college. You can also work immediately as a computer programmer, animator or medical transcriptionist but make sure you’ve already learned enough.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>c. Agri-Fisheries Strand</td></tr>
<tr><td>This strand is for those who are interested in agriculture and aquaculture. Horticulture, Pest Management, Animal Production, Slaughtering and Fish Production are all tackled here.

Graduates from this strand might be able to work in farms immediately but they can also proceed to related courses in college.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>d. Industrial Arts Strand</td></tr>
<tr><td>The last strand under the Tech-Voc track is our classical idea of what tech-voc is – Carpentry, Automotive Servicing, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning, Electronics Repair, Electrical Installation, Welding (SMAW), Plumbing and Tile Setting.

If you’ve been thinking of taking up a TESDA program for any one of these, then you should choose this strand. After Senior High School, you can apply for a TESDA Certificate of Competency or better yet, a National Certificate (NC).
